                    <h2 className="text-title">My Work</h2>
                    I have done a lot of work with HTML and CSS, as well as JavaScript. I've developed a few websites of my own and even made a few interactive projects. In the past 
                    I was a manager at a Chipotle. I basically led the kitchen part of the store and helped develop my coworkers skills. We made a lot of progress while I was there,
                    one example of this would be the store's 95% food tasting rating that our customers give. I also helped raise our through-put levels up 20%, which all that means is 
                    how fast we can get customers through the line and out the door. After Chipotle I went to a fine dining Italian restaurant in search of a new career goal. I learned 
                    a lot about cooking and even learned about myself while I was there. I did a lot of baking while I was here, I helped the baked side chef whenever we were open, and I did 
                    prep in the afternoon. I think a great place to work in the future would be for Spotify. I really love music and use their app everyday, and I feel like I would be great for their
                    culture.

                    <h2 className="text-title">Who is Jacob</h2>
                    One way I would describe myself would be driven. I have always been driven to succeed in anything that I'm taking part in. Whether this be JROTC in high school, or at my old job 
                    at Chipotle. I truly believe in bringing my best to the table, and I always offer 110% even when I'm faced with challenges. I love to make friends and I love to bond with teams.
                    I learned a lot about life through my dad, who didn't have it easy when he was growing up. He taught me a lot about doing the right thing, and he taught me a lot about 
                    sacrificing being comfortable to better yourself. He went to night school after working a hard labour job, not only because he wanted to continue his education, but because 
                    he wanted to help provide for the family. I learned a lot from the family values that I was taught growing up, and I think those values need to have some light shown on them
                    in the current generation. I take pride in everything it is that I do, I credit this to my time in JROTC, where I was taught discipline in my work and pride in what I do, at all times.
                    As serious as this has been so far, I'm really a fun person to be around and I can promise anyone reading this I'll be a great addition to a team.

                    <h2 className="text-title">My Interests</h2>
                    I have a lot of interests but I would have to say music is my favorite thing in the world. I just love the way it makes you feel and how it can even alter your state of being.
                    I love to collect records and browse the shelves at Tiger Records in downtown Jacksonville. I couldn't tell you a favorite genre or artist but I enjoy listening to any form of rock, 
                    country, folk, and orchestral music, and some of my favorite artists are Lynyrd Skynyrd, Bjork, Radiohead, and The Smiths. I have recently gotten into cinema and television. So far my 
                    favorite show is Breaking Bad and my favorite movie is No Country For Old Men, but I also love watching the Twilight series. Another hobby of mine is playing video games and board games alike.
                    Some friends and I will get together at a boardgame cafe most weekends and play for a few hours, it really helps challenge the mind while having a lot of fun doing it. Video games are really 
                    fun as well, I love playing World of Warcraft the most. I also love to study history, especially when it comes to ancient Europe and religion. There's a lot more that I find enjoyment in but 
                    I think these were the best to summarize who I am.
